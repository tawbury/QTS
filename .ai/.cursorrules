# Global Rules

## 1. Directory & Path Mapping
- **Role Definition Input**: `docs/tasks/task_<role>_<dept>.md`.
- **Evaluation Output**: `docs/reports/report_<role>_<dept>_<YYYYMMDD>.md`.
- **Agent Context**: Refer to `agents/hr/hr.agent.md` for overall execution flow.

## 2. Automated Workflow Sequence
Whenever a user requests to "create a new role" or "evaluate a position":
1.  **Generate Task**: Create a file in `docs/tasks/` using the **Task Template**.
2.  **Validate Structure**: Run `HR_Onboarding_Init` logic to ensure all Meta and Content sections exist.
3.  **Level Judgment**: Apply `HR_Level_Check` using department-specific keywords (Dev/Content).
4.  **Emit Report**: Produce the final evaluation in `docs/reports/`.

## 3. Document Templates

### [Task Template] - docs/tasks/
```markdown
# Meta
- Project Name: 
- File Name: 
- Document ID: 
- Status: Draft
- Created Date: {{CURRENT_DATE}}
- Author: {{USER}}
- Parent Document: 

---

## Department
- 
## Role Name
- 
## Expected Level
- 
## Provided Criteria
- (Define specific responsibilities and required skills here)
## Notes
- 
```

### [Report Template] - docs/reports/
(Use the structure defined in `hr_report_emit.skill.md` including the Feedback for Improvement section).

## 4. Constraint Enforcement
- **Meta Isolation**: Never use Meta section data (like Expected Level) to influence the final Evaluation Result.
- **Pending Protocol**: If criteria are insufficient, Status must be `PENDING` and the `Feedback for Improvement` section must be detailed.
- **No Natural Language**: Reports should be structured and deterministic for other agents to consume.

## 5. Language & Output Policy

- **Input Language Rule**:
  - All user inputs, task definitions, and instructions MUST be written in English.
  - If a user provides non-English input, the agent must internally normalize it to English before processing.

- **Response Language Rule**:
  - All conversational responses to the user MUST be written in Korean.

- **Report Output Language Rule**:
  - All generated report files in `docs/reports/` MUST be written in English.
  - Report structure, headings, and content must remain fully machine-readable and deterministic.

- **Precedence**:
  - In case of conflict, this Language & Output Policy overrides any implicit language assumptions in templates or agent behaviors.
